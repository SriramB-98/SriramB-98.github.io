Hi, my name is Sriram. I am currently a PhD student advised by Prof. Soheil Feizi in the Computer Science department in the University of Maryland, College Park. I am currently interested in pushing the boundaries of machine learning and AI to make them more reliable and thus applicable over a wide variety of domains.

Previously, I was a research fellow at Microsoft Research India and worked with Nagarajan Natarajan and Venkata Padmanabhan on building ML models for simulating network behaviours. I was also advised by Prof Sunita Sarawagi at IIT Bombay for my Bacehlor's thesis which involved evaluating the performance of BERT derived representations when given text with uncommon named entities.

Hi, my name is Sriram. I am currently a PhD candidate  advised by Prof. Soheil Feizi in the Computer Science department in the University of Maryland, College Park. I am particularly interested in discovering the mechanisms underlying the remarkable success of neural networks. I believe that a principled understanding of these mechanisms is essential for safely developing and reliably controlling advanced AI. More broadly, I am very concerned about the impact of advanced AI on human systems and the role of humanity in the era of widespread, superhuman AI.


Previously, I was a research fellow at Microsoft Research India and worked with Nagarajan Natarajan and Venkata Padmanabhan on building ML models for simulating network behaviours. I was also advised by Prof Sunita Sarawagi at IIT Bombay for my Bacehlor's thesis which involved evaluating the performance of BERT derived representations when given text with uncommon named entities.
